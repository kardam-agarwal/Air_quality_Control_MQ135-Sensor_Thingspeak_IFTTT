IFTTT stands for “If This Then That”. It is a free web based service to create chains of simple conditional statements, called applets.

Services are the basic building blocks of IFTTT.They mainly describe a series of data from a certain web service such as youtube etc. 
Services also describe actions controlled with certain API’s like SMS. Each service has a particular set of triggers and actions.
Applets are the predicates made from Triggers and Actions.
Triggers are the “This” part of an applet. They are the items that trigger the action.
Actions are the “That” part of an applet. They are the output that results from the input of thhe trigger.
